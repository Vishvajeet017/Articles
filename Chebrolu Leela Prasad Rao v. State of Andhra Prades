Chebrolu Leela Prasad Rao v. State of Andhra Pradesh: Affirming the 
Unconstitutionality of providing 100% Reservation
[MANU/SC/0384/2020]
Komal Ray
Background and Material Facts of the Case
1. The Governor of Andhra Pradesh in exercise of his power granted under para 5(1) of Schedule V of the 
Constitution of India, issued a Government Order which stated that the posts of teachers in educational 
institutions in Scheduled Tribe areas shall be reserved for the Scheduled Tribes only, notwithstanding 
any other order or rule or law in force.1
2. This notification was quashed by the Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal and the order was 
questioned in the Supreme court which was later dismissed as withdrawn. To amend GOMs so as to 
allow the appointment of non-tribals to the teacher posts in the scheduled areas till the time qualified 
candidates were not available from the local tribals, another G.O. was issued. 2
3. Afterwards, the non-tribals who were appointed as teachers in the Scheduled Areas filed a writ petition 
in the High Court against the termination of their services. The High court allowed the petition and held 
the orders and advertisements regarding the tribal reservation to teacher posts in the Scheduled Areas 
as violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. In the writ appeal, the Division Bench set aside the 
judgement given by the Single Judge Bench which resulted in the non-tribal appointees filing a Civil 
Appeal before the Supreme Court which was allowed by it.3
4. After this Court rendered the judgement in this appeal, the Government issued a fresh notification 
providing for 100% reservation with regards to the post of teachers in the Scheduled Areas. The GOMs 
were set aside by the Tribunal. Aggrieved by this decision, a number of writ petitions were filed in the 
High Court wherein a three-judge Bench upheld the validity of the GOs. The present appeals were filed 
against this decision.4
5. It was opined by the majority that the historically scheduled areas were given special treatment and 
affirmative action was taken to uphold the spirit of the Constitution. The notification issued by the 
Government in this regard was a step forward in increasing the literacy rates among the people 
belonging to the scheduled areas and was aimed at providing teachers in every school in the Scheduled 
Areas. Furthermore, the 100% reservation was based on intelligible differentia and the classification 
had “nexus with the object sought to be achieved”. The G.O. was necessary considering the frequent 
absence of teachers in the schools located in the Scheduled Areas and was in furtherance of promoting 
educational development of the tribals.5
6. The High Court in the minority view stated that the providing 100% reservation to the Scheduled Tribes 
in the Scheduled Areas was against the spirit of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The Governor is 
not conferred with power to formulate a law in derogation of Part III or other provisions laid down in the 
Constitution in exercise of his power under Clause I, Para 5 of Schedule V. The Court also held that the 
GOMs were discriminatory in nature as they negatively affected not only the open category candidates, 
but also the ones belonging to other Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward classes. It 
was also of the opinion that the reservation granted under Article 16(4) should not be in excess of 50%. 
However, a little relaxation in this was permitted. It also noted that the rules made under Article 309 of 
the Constitution could not be treated as an Act of the State Legislature or the Parliament.6

Issues Raised Before the Court
The issues raised before the Supreme Court are as follows:
1. “What is the scope of paragraph 5(1), Schedule V to the Constitution of India?
(a) Does the provision empower the Governor to make a new law?
(b) Does the power extend to subordinate legislation?
(c) Can the exercise of the power conferred therein override fundamental rights guaranteed under Part 
III?
(d) Does the exercise of such power override any parallel exercise of power by the President Under 
Article 371D?
2. Whether 100% reservation is permissible under the Constitution?
3. Whether the notification merely contemplates a classification Under Article 16(1) and not reservation 
Under Article 16(4)?
4. Whether the conditions of eligibility (i.e., origin and cut-off date) to avail the benefit of reservation in the 
notification are reasonable?”
Contentions Advanced On Behalf of the Appellant
1. The first contention on behalf of the Appellants was that the Governor has limited legislative power in 
modifying the existing law made by the Parliament or the State Legislature as per Para 5(1) of Schedule 
V of the Constitution of India. The power to make Regulation was accorded under Para 5(2) of Schedule 
V, as Para 5(1) conferred no such legislative power.7
2. The second contention advanced on behalf of the Appellants was that Article 371-D of the Constitution 
has special provisions regarding the State of Andhra Pradesh which is at present amended for both 
Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The Article has been amended in its application to Andhra Pradesh 
and Telangana in view of the reorganisation of the States. Article 371D was enacted after seeing the 
geographical disparities present in the areas of public employment in the State of Andhra Pradesh. This 
was because candidates from certain districts were getting selected in all the jobs in the State 
Government. To tackle this, the Presidential Order under relevant provisions was issued so as to form
local cadres for different parts of the State. Reservation on district/zonal basis was provided for different 
posts by the Presidential Order. A district/zone would be constituted by a local area. A district is 
considered a unit for teachers and all the posts in Scheduled districts have to be filled by Scheduled 
Tribe candidates.8
3. The third contention raised on behalf of the Appellants was that according to the Presidential Order 
issued under Article 371D, the candidates could not apply for a post outside their district or zone, 
depending on the case. Thus, application outside their districts cannot be made by the incumbents
which affects their chance of gaining public employment against the post of teachers. Hence, the G.O. 
was in violation of the Presidential Order issued under Article 371D of the Constitution as it is 
unconstitutional.9
4. The fourth contention advanced on behalf of the Appellants was that providing 100% reservation is not 
permissible in view of the number of decisions rendered by the Supreme Court. It is against the 
constitutional mandate and goes against the vision of the founding fathers of the Constitution. The 
reasoning of frequent absence of the teachers in the schools cannot be taken as a validate 100% 
reservation. The profession of teaching is noble and based on merit and the standard of education 
cannot be compromised by granting cent percent reservation. 100% reservation is not permitted by the
Constitution of India with regards to any particular class or category with the resultant exclusion of 
others. Furthermore, reservation granted under Article 16 should not be in excess of 50%.10

5. The fifth contention raised on behalf of the Appellants was that the G.O. issued was in contravention of 
the aim of the Constitution which seeks to provide protective legislation. The main objective of 
reservation was to bring the disadvantaged communities to the forefront of development. The proposal 
of tribal students to be taught by tribal teachers would be equal to compromising with the quality of the 
education provided as well as excluding such children from the mainstream. 
6. The sixth contention advanced on behalf of the Appellants was that the provisions of Rules 22 and 22A 
of the Andhra Pradesh State and Subordinate Service Rules, 1996, provided for reservation under 
proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution and it was not framed by the legislature. Hence, it could not 
have been amended or modified by the Governor in exercise of his power under Para 5(1) of Schedule 
V of the Constitution, it being subordinate legislation. The Acts which were mentioned in the G.O. did 
not concern reservation and the Act of 1997 which provided for reservation was not amended. Even if 
it was amended, it was not possible to provide 100% reservation.11
7. The seventh contention advanced on behalf of the Appellants was that the classification created within 
the people belonging to Scheduled Tribes so as to “benefit only the candidates or their parents residing 
in the Scheduled Areas since benefit only the candidates or their parents continuously residing in the 
scheduled areas since 26.1.1950 is arbitrary, illegal, and discriminatory vis-a-vis the scheduled tribes 
also, besides other categories”. The reservation could not have been provided under executive order 
and the legislation was necessary to grant 100% reservation. Treating the case on the ground of 
doctrine of basic structure is not suitable as the case does not question the provisions of Para 5 of 
Schedule V of the Constitution, but only the legality of the action thereunder. Furthermore, the right of 
judicial review exists with respect to any action taken which is arbitrary, illegal or violative of the 
fundamental rights.12
Contentions Advanced on Behalf of the Respondent
1. The first contention advanced on behalf of the Respondents was that the Constitution of India has 
special provisions for the advancement of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes enshrined in 
Articles 15 and 16 as well as the Directive Principles laid down in Articles 37, 38, 47 and 51(A). 
Furthermore, there are provisions providing for reservation to SC/STs in Lok Sabha, State Assemblies 
etc. It was further argued that the normal rule of 50% reservation could be relaxed in appropriate cases 
by an executive order. The reservations provided to the candidates belonging to the Scheduled Tribes 
were in view of the discrimination and disadvantage faced by them and the scope of judicial review is 
limited in such cases.13
2. The second contention raised on behalf of the Respondents was that the GO issued was constitutionally 
valid. Furthermore, the purpose of Article 371D and Para 5 of Schedule V of the Constitution are 
completely different. It was further argued that to ensure that the benefits reached the ones in need, the 
‘bottoms up’ approach should be followed. It was also argued that in event of the Court quashing the 
GO, the appointments already made should not be disturbed.14
3. The third contention advanced on behalf of the Respondents was that “the scheme of Schedule V, as 
a whole, deserves to be dealt with on a special constitutional footing, that is an exclusive constitutional 
enclave, free in its ambit to ensure the promotion of the interests, concerns and the development of 
scheduled areas. Paras 2 and 5 of the Fifth Schedule constitute its essence. Para 2 enacts limitations 
on the executive power of the State concerning the scheduled areas. Para 5 is a composite and 
particular species of the enabling power, conferring on the Governor, legislative, and administrative 
powers. The legislative and administrative powers run seamlessly. For instance, the power under 
Clause (1) of Para 5 to extend a Central or State legislation to the scheduled area, subject to exceptions 
and modifications, confer a power to amend the legislation. The power under clauses (1) and (2) 
operates in distinct fields to achieve distinct purposes, each of them wide in their way. The object to be 
achieved under Clause (1) is to evaluate and assess the relevance, fitness, or inappropriateness of any 
11 ibid [17].

law in their application to scheduled areas, the domain of policy with considerable latitude to bring into 
force with modifications and exceptions any law”.15
4. The fourth contention advanced on behalf of the Respondents was that the Scheduled Tribes and 
Scheduled Tribes constitute a special class and can be dealt with on a special basis. Moreover, the GO 
was not passed to favour the local Scheduled Tribes or discriminate against the others. It was issued 
so as to further the educational interests of the Scheduled Areas and even if it promotes a class interest, 
and it cannot be scrutinised under Articles 14 and 16(1).
16
5. The fifth contention raised on behalf of the Respondents was that the Schedule V and Article 371D 
were not in conflict with each other. Both these provisions operate in different territories. Moreover, the 
socio-economic experiments formulated by the Legislature and in this case, by the Governor cannot be 
a matter of judicial scrutiny.17
6. The sixth contention advanced on behalf of the Respondents was that schedule V is not a case of 
reservation at all. Its purpose is to further the educational interests of the tribal population. The nonavailability of teachers in the tribal schools were taken cognizance of by the Governor who then issued 
the notification that the tribal teachers should have reservation in the school of their area so that the 
educational interest of the Scheduled Areas could be promoted.18
7. The seventh contention raised on behalf of the Appellants was that the “ the scheduled area is extended
over 31,485 sq. km. which is about 11% of the total area of the State with more than 5938 villages 
distributed in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, West Godavari, Khammam, 
Warangal, Adilabad and Mahaboobnagar Districts. Scheduled Tribe students are at a disadvantageous 
position. The non-attendance of teachers was more in the scheduled areas, so to provide the facility of 
teaching, classification has been made. It cannot be said to be a case of providing reservations. The 
Government of Andhra Pradesh, Department of Tribal Welfare, has established various categories of 
educational institutions to cater to the needs of Scheduled Tribes children in the State”.19
8. The eighth contention advanced on behalf of the Respondents was that the Scheduled Areas cannot 
be compared to areas administered by the Act of Legislatures. Schedule V has special provisions in 
place for such areas and an order issued by the Governor has to be treated as Legislation. Moreover, 
the “order of Governor can only be tested on the parameters of competence and violation of the 
Constitution. It cannot be tested on the touchstone of ideal norms. It achieves the purpose of Article 46 
of the Constitution”.
20
9. The ninth contention raised on behalf of the Respondents was that the Scheduled Areas are separated 
from other areas through forests or hills. Such areas are also residence to some non-tribals. However, 
the non-tribals cannot “acquire by sale, purchase, lease, or otherwise, the lands in the scheduled areas 
and legislations imposing such restrictions have been held to be constitutional by this Court in various 
decisions”. This is so because the tribals have their own unique customs, traditions, cultures and 
personal laws which should be protected and preserved. The teachers appointed in the Scheduled 
Areas were frequently absent due to lack of facilities and inaccessibility due to which the experiment 
was carried out and it proved to be successful as a significance increase in the literacy rates of the 
tribals was observed. 21
10. The tenth contention advanced on behalf of the Respondents was that since the Governor has the 
power to formulate the regulations, “the power is extends to subordinate legislation also”. Moreover, in 
exceptional circumstances, 100% reservation is permissible and it has limited scope for judicial 
review.22

Invocation of the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction
The Court in this case invoked the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction. This doctrine provides that “a 
statute should be read as a whole and one provision of the Act should be construed with reference to 
other provisions in the same Act so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole statute. Such an 
interpretation is beneficial in avoiding any inconsistency or repugnancy either within a section or 
between a section and other parts of the statute. 
The five main principles of this rule are: 
1. The courts must avoid a head on clash of seemingly contradicting provisions and they must construe 
the contradictory provisions so as to harmonize them. 
2. The provision of one section cannot be used to defeat the provision contained in another unless the 
court, despite all its effort, is unable to find a way to reconcile their differences. 
3. When it is impossible to completely reconcile the differences in contradictory provisions, the courts must 
interpret them in such as way so that effect is given to both the provisions as much as possible. 
4. Courts must also keep in mind that interpretation that reduces one provision to a useless number or 
dead is not harmonious construction. 
5. To harmonize is not to destroy any statutory provision or to render it fruitless.”
Reliance by the Court on Treatise on Constitutional Law (Fifth Edition) by Ronald D. 
Rotunda
The Supreme Court in the present case relied upon the following part of this treatise –
In this book, it has been observed that “law should be tested on traditional rational standards and Court 
need not review seriously suspect classification. Following observations have been made: The Court, 
in an opinion by Justice White, found that the retirement classification should be tested by general equal 
protection principles, but that it did not violate the equal protection guarantee. Although the parties 
agreed that the law should be tested under the traditional rational basis standard, Justice White's 
opinion stressed that the federal judiciary is not to review seriously those classifications that do not 
involve fundamental rights or suspect classifications:
The Constitution presumes that, absent some reason to infer antipathy, even improvident decisions will 
eventually be rectified by the democratic process and that judicial intervention is generally unwarranted 
no matter how unwisely we may think a political branch has acted. Thus, we will not overturn such a 
statute unless the varying treatment of different groups or persons is so unrelated to the achievement 
of any combination of legitimate purposes that we can only conclude that the legislature's actions were 
irrational”.
Significant Precedent Cases Discussed by the Court
1. Samatha v. State of Andhra Pradesh23
The Supreme Court relied on the following para of this judgment to support its reasoning in the present 
case –
“71. Thus, the Fifth and Sixth Schedules, an integral scheme of the Constitution with direction, 
philosophy and anxiety is to protect the tribals from exploitation and to preserve valuable endowment 
of their land for their economic empowerment to elongate social and economic democracy with liberty, 
equality, fraternity and dignity of their person in our political Bharat.”
23 MANU/SC/1325/1997.

2. Jatindra v. Province of Bihar24
The Court relied upon this judgement to show that the “the power of the Governor under para 5 is a 
legislative power and Governor is empowered to change or modify the provisions of the Act or the 
Section as he deems fit by way of issuing a notification. The power under para 5(1) is limited to the 
application of the Governor's decision to apply an Act or making modification or creating exceptions. 
Though the power is legislative to some extent, that is confined to applicability, modification, or creating 
exceptions concerning the Act of the Parliament or the State. While para 5(2) confers the power of 
independent legislation, the Governor has plenary power of framing regulations for the peace and good 
governance of a scheduled area. He is the repository of faith to decide as to the necessity. The Governor 
is empowered by para 5(3) to repeal or amend any Act of Parliament or State Legislature, following the 
procedure prescribed therein, in exercise of making regulations as provided under para 5(2) of Schedule 
V”.
While there were numerous other cases mentioned and discussed by the Counsels on behalf of both
the parties, none of them were relied upon by the Supreme Court.
Judgment in Personam [Concrete Judgment]
The Court while allowing the appeal held the following:
1. “The exceptions and modifications were created by the law, which is already applicable in the area. It 
is not the formulation of a new law which is contemplated under Para 5(1) of Schedule V. No new law 
could be formulated while exercising power under Para 5(1) of Schedule V. The power of modification 
could not extend to re-writing the entire statute. The power could not be used to supplant the law, which 
was applicable. The law had to be applied only with exceptions or modifications. It could not totally 
supersede the existing law, which was wholly opposed to the idea of applicable law as in that case it 
would tantamount to the new law and not the modification or exception or creation of exceptions or 
modifications to the applicable law. The object and substance of law applicable cannot be changed 
within the purview of Para 5(1), though the applicability of applicable law could be excluded. In case the 
Governor decides the law to remain applicable, he had the power only to create exceptions and to 
modify the same, not to create a new one juxtaposed to the same applicable law.25
2. The A.P. Regulation of Reservation and Appointment to Public Services Act, 1997, deals with 
reservation in the State in the field of public services. G.O. did not amend the said Act. The provisions 
of the other Acts mentioned in the notification did not deal with the extent of reservation. Sections 78 
and 79 of the A.P. Education Act, 1982 and Sections 169, 195, and 268 of the A.P. Panchayati Raj Act, 
1994, were not related to reservation. The Rules were framed under the proviso to Article 309. They 
were not framed under the main provision by the legislature. The Governor in the exercise of power 
under Para 5(1) of Schedule V could have amended the Public Services Act, 1997, or direct it not to 
apply to Scheduled Areas. The creation of hundred per cent reservation had the effect of making a new 
law under Para 5(1) without reference to the Act of State or Central legislation. Independently of that 
power could not be exercised within the purview of Para 5(1) of Schedule V to the Constitution of India. 
Even otherwise, even if the Act of 1997 would have been modified by the Governor, hundred percent 
reservation could not have been provided.26
3. The Governor’s power to make new law is not available in view of the clear language of Para 5(1), Fifth 
Schedule does not recognise or confer such power, but only power was not to apply the law or to apply 
it with exceptions or modifications. Thus, notification was ultra vires to Para 5(1) of Schedule V of the 
Constitution.27
4. The Rules framed under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution could not be said to be the Act of 
Parliament or State legislature. Though the Rules had the statutory force, they cannot be said to have 
been framed under any Act of Parliament or State legislature. The Rules remain in force till such time 
the legislature exercises power. The power of the Governor under Para 5(1) of Schedule V of the 
24 [(1949) FL J 225.
25 ibid [49].
26 ibid [50].
27 ibid [51].
Published in Article section of www.manupatra.com
Constitution is restricted to modifying or not to apply, Acts of the Parliament or legislature of the State. 
Thus, the Rules could not have been amended in the exercise of the powers conferred under Para 5(1) 
of Schedule V. The Rules made under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution cannot be said to be an 
enactment by the State legislature. Thus, it was not open to the Governor to issue the impugned G.O.28
5. The power was conferred on the Governor to deal with the scheduled areas. It was not meant to prevail 
over the Constitution. The power of the Governor was pari passu with the legislative power of Parliament 
and the State. The legislative power could be exercised by the Parliament or the State subject to the 
provisions of Part III of the Constitution. The power of the Governor did not supersede the fundamental 
rights under Part III of the Constitution. It had to be exercised subject to Part III and other provisions of 
the Constitution. When Para 5 of the Fifth Schedule confers power on the Governor, it was not meant 
to be conferral of arbitrary power. The Constitution could never aim to confer any arbitrary power on the 
constitutional authorities. They were to be exercised in a rational manner keeping in view the objectives 
of the Constitution. The powers were not in derogation but the furtherance of the constitutional aims 
and objectives.29
6. Considering the geographical disparity in public employment, Article 371D was inserted in the 
Constitution, providing candidates from certain districts/zones to form the local cadre for different posts 
for different parts of the States. The Presidential Order was issued providing district/zone for local cadre, 
on the other hand, the order issued by the Governor has reserved all the posts of teachers in the 
Scheduled Areas for Schedule Tribe candidates. The aspiring candidates of the district/zone in the 
Scheduled Area could not apply for the post of teachers in the district as hundred per cent reservation 
was made vide G.O. by the Governor. It was also not disputed that aspiring candidates cannot apply 
outside the district/zone because of the restrictions under Article 371D of the Constitution. As there was 
hundred per cent reservation provided for the Scheduled Tribes in the Scheduled Areas, other 
candidates of Scheduled Castes, General and Other Backward Classes category cannot apply at all in 
other districts. They were being denied the opportunity of getting the employment as against the posts 
in question. Thus, the order issued by the Governor was clearly in conflict with the Presidential Order 
issued under Article 371D. The candidates of local areas or other candidates except for Scheduled 
Tribes had been deprived of the opportunity of seeking public employment because of the order issued 
by the Governor, and they could not apply outside the local area in view of the Presidential notification.30
7. The G.O. in question requires candidate or the parents to reside in the area. There was no rhyme or 
reason to require continuous residence for last fifty years or more. It overlooks the rights of various 
other persons who might have settled decades together in the area in question. It was discriminatory 
vis- a -vis to the scheduled tribes also settled in the area and it had no purpose to be achieved and 
imposes restriction which was not even provided in the Presidential Order issued under Article 371D of 
the Constitution of India with respect to residential or educational requirements. Thus, it did not lay 
down valid conditions. The same was fixed in highly unreasonable and arbitrary manner and limits zone 
of consideration to miniscule where an opportunity for public employment has to be afforded to all 
concerned with reasonable rights”.

Judgment in Rem [Ratio Decidendi]
Ensuring the well-being and advancement of the Scheduled Tribes cannot be at the cost of enacting 
rules and regulations that are in contravention of the provisions laid down in the Constitution of India. 
100% reservation for a particular community would go against the Fundamental Rights of the 
Constitution which provides for equal opportunities for all the citizens. Thus, the policies made for the 
advancement of the Scheduled Tribes should be not at the cost of depriving others of similar 
opportunities. This judgment overruled the decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in this case.
Social Relevance of the Judgment
This judgment is extremely socially relevant in understanding the structural and systemic flaws which 
pervade the educational infrastructure of the tribals in India. As was pointed out by the Respondents, 
28 ibid [57].
29 ibid [78].
30 ibid [89].
31 ibid [147].
Published in Article section of www.manupatra.com
the educational development of tribal population in India is often hindered by the frequent absenteeism 
of teachers in schools located in the Scheduled Areas. The unavailability of facilities coupled with the 
difficulty in access leads to the teachers frequently missing the classes. To address this issue, the 
Governor of Andhra Pradesh issued the notification stating that all the teacher posts in the Scheduled 
Areas should be reserved for the candidates belonging to that area. This would serve two purposes. 
Firstly, since the teachers would reside in the Scheduled Areas, the issue of frequent absenteeism 
would be solved. Secondly, since the local candidates would be fluent in the local languages, it would 
be easier for them to communicate with the students as the non-tribal teachers are often not familiar 
with the local tribal languages.
The notification had the potential to advance the educational interests of the tribal population which is 
often neglected. As a matter of fact, previous such experiments had shown positive results. However, 
the judgment of the Supreme Court citing the order as arbitrary and unconstitutional raises the question 
of whether provisions of the Constitution whose spirit is to advance the social, cultural and economic 
well-being of the Scheduled Tribes should be construed in strict technical sense or whether the scope 
of interpretation of such provisions should be broadened so as to truly ensure justice to the 
advancement of the this community.
Concluding Remarks
The Supreme Court has clearly pointed out in its judgment that the notification issued by the Governor 
of Andhra Pradesh raised serious concerns over the exercise of power granted to the Governor in an 
arbitrary and unconstitutional manner. The Court made it clear that the administrative machinery is 
supposed to act within the bounds of the Constitution. Furthermore, the need for better educational 
infrastructure for the Scheduled Areas was noted by the Court and suggestions such as providing better 
incentives to teachers posted in these areas was given by it. The issue at hand is a truly debatable one 
and has convincing arguments from both sides. If the posts are reserved for the Scheduled Tribes 
residing in such areas, it would raise grave concerns over the quality of the education being imparted. 
However, if they are not reserved for the resident Scheduled Tribes, then the question arises as to who 
would teach the students as the posts would remain vacant by and large. 
Additionally, the issue of the Governor’s power with respect to issuing an order or notification for the 
Scheduled Areas to the exclusion of any other law or rule has also been discussed at length by the 
Supreme Court. Furthermore, the concerns over such orders or notifications being in direct conflict with 
the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution or the Presidential notifications was also 
elaborately discussed by the Court. It is an accepted fact that the idea of reservation is not against 
merit. Rather, it works towards creating a special, yet reasonable classification so as to provide a levelplaying field to everyone. However, reservation in excess of what is provided by the Constitution cannot 
be justified and is constitutionally invalid as is made evident by this judgment.
