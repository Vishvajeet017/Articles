Competition Commission of India vs. Amazon, Flipkart: A Case Study
Vaishnavi Shetty*
Mumbai, India
The Karnataka High Court dismissed a writ petition filed by Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart, 
two of the country's major E-commerce enterprises. The petition was filed in response to a preliminary 
investigation order issued by the Competition Commission of India into their alleged anti-competitive 
practices. The writ petition was dismissed by Justice PS Dinesh Kumar, who cited the limitations of 
the power of judicial review under Article 226 of the constitution to intervene with a probe ordered by 
an expert specialised authority.

The Competition Commission of India (hereafter referred to as CCI) issued the contested 
order in January 2020 in response to a complaint filed by the Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh (respondent

No.2), a Society comprising of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises registered under the Societies 
Registration Act of 1860.* The Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh (hereafter referred to as DVM) filed 
information alleging a violation of Section 3(1) read with Section 3(4) of the Competition Act, as well 
as Sections 4(1) and 4(2) of the Competition Act, and requested instructions for an investigation 
under Section 26(1) of the Competition Act. The society alleged that Amazon and Flipkart were giving 
preferential treatment to a select group of vendors by having indirect control over their operations, 
particularly the launch of smartphones. E-commerce enterprises, according to the DVM, were 
exploiting their competitive position.
*
When the competition watchdog launched its inquiry, it identified four alleged anti-competitive 
practises. These were, exclusive launches of mobile phones by e-commerce companies, promotions 
of preferred sellers on their websites, deep discounting practises and prioritisation of some seller 
listings over others.
Contentions of the petitioners before the Honorable High Court:
a) The impugned order is ultra vires to the object and purpose of the Competition Act.
b) The informant, Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, acted on behalf of the Confederation of All India 
Traders, which initiated multiple proceedings against petitioners but failed to obtain any order.
c) The Commission had diverged from its previous practice.
d) Petitioners were not given any notice. Previously, when dealing with similar charges, the 
Commission had granted an opportunity for hearing before forming a preliminary opinion.
e) The contested order is not a reasoned order since there is no analysis with regard to Appreciable 
Adverse Effect on Competition.
f) The CCI's jurisdiction is barred due to a pending investigation by the Enforcement Directorate; 
and 
g) The impugned order is an abuse of process of law and would cause the petitioners great 
hardship.*
Amazon's senior Advocate, Gopal Subramanian, argued that there was no jurisdictional fact 
allowing CCI to issue the order. First, there must be an agreement; second, it must be between firms 
located at different stages of the production or supply chain; and third, it must cause or be likely to 
cause Appreciable Adverse Effect on Competition. These prerequisites have not been met. Hence, 
there is no application of mind.

Senior Advocates Uday Holla and Dhyan Chinnappa, representing Flipkart, argued that the 
anti-trust body's preliminary findings are not supported by any evidence or materials. They also stated 
that no deal with an adverse effect on competition has been placed on record. Product manufacturers 
sell their wares on Flipkart's online marketplace. It is the seller's discretion to sell exclusively on 
Flipkart's marketplace, and Flipkart cannot be held liable for the same.
*
Statement of objections by the Competition Commission of India:
a) An order made by the Commission under Section 26(1) of the Act is an ‘Administrative Order' 
instructing one of its wings to conduct Departmental proceedings. It does not establish any 
party's right or obligation, nor does it imply any civil consequences. 
b) Petitioners have not contested the Commission's inherent jurisdiction to conduct a direct 
investigation.
c) Malafides or the exercise of jurisdiction in an inappropriate or extraneous manner are the only 
grounds for exercising the power of judicial review of administrative orders. Petitioners have not 
asserted any wrongdoing on the part of the Commission while issuing the contested order.
d) There is no explicit legislation or industry regulator governing the e-commerce sector.
e) The informant claims that petitioners have entered into vertical agreements with 'preferred 
sellers,' which has resulted in the foreclosure of 'non-preferred sellers' from the Online Market 
places.
f) The Commission has examined several issues in the context of a breach of Section 3(4) of the 
Act, as well as the complexities involved in the parameters of 'inter-platform,' 'intra-platform,' and 
'inter-channel distribution.' In the impugned order, the Commission noted the existence of 
favoured sellers, preferential listing, and so on.
g) One of the three possible 'starting points' for an investigation is information under Section 
19(1)(a) of the Act. The Commission may also conduct an investigation on its own initiative. In 
view of the Act's investigative system, the contents of information will become secondary when 
the investigation report is filed.
h) The fact that the informant operated independently or at the request of CAIT is completely 
irrelevant to the Commission. The Commission is simply concerned with the significant claim 
provided in the information, which it believes should be investigated. Furthermore, the 
Commission has requested that the informant provide a certificate under Section 65(b) of the 
Indian Evidence Act, 1872
i) Commission is not the only anti-trust regulator which has initiated enquiry against Amazon. 
European Commission, in July 2019 has initiated formal investigation against Amazon on the 
aspect of collection of competition sensitive data of sellers on the marketplace and its potential 
misuse. *

Accordingly, the High court of Karnataka framed three points that required consideration in this case:
A. What is the nature of the contested order issued according to Section 26(1) of the Act?
B. Is prior notice and a chance to be heard mandatory when directing the Director General to 
conduct an inquiry under Section 26(1) of the Act?
C. Whether contested order calls for interference?
Issue A and B: Findings of the Court
Points A and B are inter-connected and hence were dealt together. Starting with Section 19 of 
the Act which clearly states, the Commission may inquire into allegation of contravention of provisions 
of the Act either on its own motion or on receipt of any information accompanied by such fee as may 
be determined by the Regulations or upon a reference made by the Central Government or a State 
Government or a Statutory Authority. *
In a nutshell, Section 26 of the Competition Act, 2002 authorises the CCI to request an 
investigation by the Director General (hereafter referred to as DG) in cases of “prima facie” violations 
of the Act. A prima facie case does not mean a case proved exhaustively, but a case which can be 
said to be established, if the evidence which is led in support of the same were believed.* Pertinently, 
the result of such an investigation under no circumstance is bound to influence the final decision given 
by the CCI. DG’s investigation is imperative to analyze and understand the facts and issues of the 
matter.
Although such an investigation appears to be procedural in nature, it is critical to understand 
what threshold of proof qualifies as a ‘prima-facie' breach for the CCI for a variety of reasons:
a) Firstly, because the CCI has limited finances and operates within limited resources, it must 
conduct a cost-benefit analysis while conducting such an investigation. 
b) Secondly, such an investigation conducted by the CCI plays a direct role in determining the 
business practises adopted by the parties, so that they follow this set pattern to avoid judicial 
scrutiny.
c) Lastly, the framework of the Competition Act, 2002 does not allow the CCI to identify an ultimate 
contravention unless and until the Director General orders an investigation. The aforementioned 
structure of the Act permits the opposing parties concerned in the matter to defend themselves at 
two stages, namely during the investigation stage and after the report is submitted to the DG.
In regard to the nature of the impugned order, Smt. Madhavi Diwan, learned Additional 
Solicitor General for Commission submitted that it is an administrative order. In support of this

submission, CCI v. SAIL and CCI v. Bharathi Airtel were referred.*
In CCI v. SAIL, it was held that the 
threshold requirement for establishing prima facie case at the stage of Section 26(1), is a low 
threshold.* The direction under Section 26(1) after the formation of a prima facie opinion is a direction 
simpliciter to cause an investigation into the matter. Issuance of such a direction, at the face of it, is 
an administrative direction to one of its own wings departmentally and is without entering upon any 
adjudicatory process. 
Closure of the case results in the determination of rights and affects a party, namely the 
informant; as a result, the said party has the right to appeal such closure of the case under Section 
26(2) of the Act. On the other hand, simply directing an investigation to one of the Commission's 
wings is akin to a departmental proceeding that does not carry civil consequences for any person, 
especially in light of the strict confidentiality that the Commission is expected to maintain in 
accordance with Section 57 of the Act and Regulation 35 of the Regulations. In other words, the 
Commission is expected to express a prima facie opinion in accordance with Section 26(1) of the Act, 
without engaging in any adjudicatory or determinative process, and by recording the minimum of 
reasons substantiating the formation of such opinion, while all its other orders and decisions should 
be well reasoned.*
With respect to Point B, Section 26 (1) clearly states that- ‘On receipt of a complaint or a 
reference from the Central Government or a State Government or a statutory authority or on its own 
knowledge or information, under Section 19, if the Commission is of the opinion that there exists a 
prima facie case, it shall direct the Director General to cause an investigation to be made into the 
matter.’*
It was concluded that Section 26(1) of the Act does not mention about the issuance of any 
notice to any party before or at the time of formation of an opinion by the Commission on the basis of 
information received by it. The act does mention, forwarding a copy of the report created by the DG to 
the parties concerned or to the Central Government or the State Government or the statutory 
authority, as the case may be under Section 26 (4). But the same is to be done only after an 
investigation has been done by the DG not before.*
Issue C:
Issue C which dealt with whether or not the CCI order ‘calls for interference’ was discussed 
and both the sides put forward their points. The Court observed that the Competition Commission of 
India is required to form an opinion as to the existence of a prima facie case at the outset of an 
investigation, and that "a plain reading of the impugned order shows that the Commission has looked 
into the information in detail and applied its mind."*

As a result, the single judge bench of the Karnataka High Court dismissed the writ petitions, 
concluding that the limited grounds for judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution of India 
were not met in this case. The single judge bench also stated that it would be unwise to prejudge the 
issues at this stage and scuttle the CCI's investigation.
Conclusion
Based on the research and study conducted on the above matter, the Judgment appears to 
have squandered a chance to clarify and resolve the law in instances involving simultaneous 
investigations or similar difficulties, and its handling of these matters may have opened the door to 
lengthy litigation. It is critical to develop and execute a clear and consistent strategy for India's ecommerce industry, since frequent changes, limited interpretations of legislation, and overregulation 
of the sector would stifle innovation, subtract from consumer welfare, damage investor confidence, 
and have an undesirable effect on competition.
