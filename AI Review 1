Literature Survey:
[1] "A Survey of Text Summarization Techniques" by Ani Nenkova and Kathleen McKeown, in Mining Text Data, Springer, 2012. This paper provides an overview of various text summarization techniques, including those specific to legal text. This article provides a comprehensive overview of different approaches to text summarization, which may be helpful for researchers and practitioners who are new to the field or who are seeking to compare different techniques. This article provides a broad overview of different text summarization techniques, but it may not provide as much depth or specificity as other papers that focus on a particular approach or application. This limitation could be complemented by more in-depth research papers that focus on specific approaches or applications of text summarization, in order to provide a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the field.
[2] "Legal Text Summarization using Latent Dirichlet Allocation" by F. Chen, H. Jiang, J. Wang, and J. Wu, in Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing, 2020. This paper proposes a legal text summarization approach based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. This article proposes a novel approach to legal text summarization that leverages the LDA algorithm. This approach may be advantageous because LDA has been shown to be effective at identifying latent topics in text data. This article proposes a novel approach to legal text summarization, but it may not be as widely adopted or well-known as other techniques, which could make it more difficult to compare and replicate results. This limitation could be further tested and evaluated on different legal text datasets, in order to demonstrate its effectiveness and to allow for more meaningful comparisons with other techniques 
[3] "Summarizing Legal Documents: A Preliminary Study on the Impact of Text Features on Performance" by A. Mahmoud and A. Ahmed, in Proceedings of the 2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing, 2020. This paper investigates the effect of text features, such as sentence length and keyword frequency, on the performance of legal text summarization models. This article provides insights into the impact of different text features on the performance of legal text summarization models. By understanding which features are most important for summarization, researchers and practitioners may be able to develop more accurate and effective models. This article provides useful insights into the impact of different text features on summarization performance, but it may be limited by the specific dataset and evaluation metrics used in the study. This disadvantage could be expanded to include a wider range of text features and evaluation metrics, in order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence summarization performance.
[4] "Automatic Text Summarization of Legal Documents using Deep Learning" by M. O. Siddiqui and N. C. Mithun, in Proceedings of the 2021 IEEE International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication and Control, 2021. This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach for summarizing legal text. This article proposes a deep learning-based approach to legal text summarization, which may be advantageous because deep learning has been shown to be effective at identifying complex patterns in large datasets. This article proposes a deep learning-based approach to legal text summarization, which may require large amounts of data and computing resources to train and optimize. This limitation proposes a deep learning-based approach to legal text summarization, which may be advantageous because deep learning has been shown to be effective at identifying complex patterns in large datasets.
[5] "Legal Text Summarization using Graph-Based Approaches" by G. Antoniou, A. Mouzakitis, and S. Skiadopoulos, in Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, 2013. This paper presents a graph-based approach for summarizing legal text, which considers both the content and structure of the document. This article proposes a graph-based approach to legal text summarization, which takes into account both the content and structure of the document. This approach may be advantageous because it allows for a more nuanced understanding of the document's meaning and may lead to more accurate summaries. This article proposes a graph-based approach to legal text summarization, which may require a higher level of technical expertise to implement and may not be as accessible to non-experts. This disadvantage "Legal Text Summarization using Graph-Based Approaches" proposes a graph-based approach to legal text summarization, which takes into account both the content and structure of the document. This approach may be advantageous because it allows for a more nuanced understanding of the document's meaning and may lead to more accurate summaries.
